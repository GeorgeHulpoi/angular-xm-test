**Task description** Create a photo library that includes an infinite random photostream, with the ability to save photos to your “Favorites” library. ● Design ○ Below are wireframes, which give a general view of what the pages should look like ○ The theme (e.g colors, fonts) you can choose by yourself ● Header ○ Consists of 2 buttons and allows you to switch between your “Favorites” library and a random photostream. ○ An active view must be highlighted. ● “Photos” screen has an infinite scrollable list of photos ○ Located at / path. ○ Clicking a photo adds it to Favorites. ○ When scrolling, new photos should be loaded. Loader icon should be displayed. ○ Use [https://picsum.photos/200/300](https://picsum.photos/200/300) to get random images (or any other resource). ○ Emulate real-world API, when getting photos. Loading new photos should have a random delay of 200-300ms.

● “Favorites” screen ○ Located at /favorites path. ○ Contains a list of favorite photos (no need for infinite scrolling here, just list of all photos). ○ Clicking on a photo opens a single photo page. ○ Favorites list should persist after a page refresh. ● Single photo page ○ Located at /photos/:id path. ○ Shows just a single full-screen photo, instead of a grid. ○ Should contain the “Remove from favorites” button. ○ The header remains the same on this page.
